# Dijkstra-Solver ðŸ¤–

A project for a course at Uni where I built a solver in C that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path. The solver was applied to a game called Sokoban, the aim of the game is to move a box to the objective and can differ on difficulty based on the map's structure.
- Here is an example of Sokoban gameplay:

- Here is an example of the solver being used on different maps:
